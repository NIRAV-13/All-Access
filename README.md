# Application Introduction:

Accessible Education is the process of designing courses and developing a teaching style to meet the needs of people from a variety of backgrounds, abilities, and learning styles. Just as there is no single way to teach, people learn in a variety of ways; using different instructional methods will help meet the needs of the greatest number of learners. Universities are legally bound to provide accessibility support to students who require assistance to meet their accessibility needs due to various challenges faced by them in their learning process. Very common accessibility support in academia extended to students is an academic accommodation. Accommodation reduces or removes barriers faced by people with disabilities or special needs to ensure fair and equitable access to classrooms, testing, co-op/fieldwork environments, extra-curricular activities, etc. Different universities provide different accommodations to students based on the unique physical and mental health challenges that the student might face. Academic Accommodations intends to provide support for students to make the most out of their courses by providing equitable access to the material and its delivery as well as help in making a fair assessment of the students with different needs. We noticed that the process for requesting an accommodation and getting it approved or getting help regarding accessibility needs can often be slow, convoluted, and decentralized

## What We Propose:

We propose to build an android native mobile app that offers a clean, comprehensive, well-designed, centralized, and optimal experience for the accessibility and accommodation management process at the Postsecondary/University level. The app will be user-friendly and would allow Accessibility Centers of various universities to let Students, Instructors, and Advisors communicate with each other, let students timely request accommodations, allow advisors to approve those accommodations, and then notify the instructors of the relevant accommodation a student in their course has. The app will have three flows; the Student flow where the students can log in, book an appointment with an advisor, download/upload relevant documents, submit forms for their accommodation requests, and chat with the advisors; the Advisor flow where the Advisors will be able to accept or reject (re-schedule) appointments with students, access the
forms uploaded by the students, provide approval for accommodations requests, and then inform instructors about the accommodations granted to all the students in their course; and the Instructor/Professor flow, which will let the instructors communicate with Advisors about policies and how to go about implementing the granted accommodations, see the names of the students and which specific accommodations they have.
